      <h1>Our Journey</h1>
      <p>
        I always had faith in my intuitions and a promising spiritual soul.
        That's where my journey beganâ€” now being my business which initially
        started with shuffling tarot cards and looking up for different crystals
        aligning with my zodiac. "It is never too late to be what you might have
        been." I began my journey with a stumbling foot with no opportunity un
        turn. Bring things that add meaning to it, and my business did it! Not a
        day goes away where I don't thank God for blessing me with such kind
        customers and for the industry to do well. However, the journey hasn't
        always been easy, as "People will always have their opinion on you
        despite who you are and what you're capable of." As rightly said, people
        who didn't appreciate my work and hard work existed, but I never gave
        them the upper hand. Belive yourself is always a good mantra for me; I
        believe myself, and so should you too.
